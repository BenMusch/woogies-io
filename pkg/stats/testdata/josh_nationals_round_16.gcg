#note J4 (E)DH wins the sim by a lot, but I didn't think I could win by blocking the 7H spot. I was hoping he wouldn't punish me too hard for H12 H(A)D letting me bing out at 7H or on the M column to win. I suppose blocking the M column is really difficult which is why it sims so well, but I'm not entirely sure.
