#note didn't know FREAKERY! more problematically, I neglected all the good plays I have on this turn and played a phony?! lmao play FYKE at least
>Ayotunde_Adeyeri: EILR 4H RI.LE +18 92
>JD: ACEOOQR -OOQ +0 106
#note ACEOOR seemed to do nothing useful. it's pretty even on a sim, but Q thinks the outside shots of CARETOOK and CORONAE make it worth playing through.

#note a major mistake if I think he's going to find and play UNITINGS#. It's in my cardbox but it doesn't look like a real word to me still!
>Ayotunde_Adeyeri: IINNSTU 5J .IN +12 142
>JD: ABDLMUV 2F VUM +23 239
#note in an ideal world I'd blocked the ATTERCOPS hook, but couldn't find a decent play that did so.
>Ayotunde_Adeyeri: EINRSTU O8 TRIUNES +87 229
>JD: ABDELOO E2 OBOL +21 260
#note didn't love this, but also failed to spot anything much better. Q likes BOOLED at E1 which doesn't give up as many cheap points. Q thinks ADE only bingos 18% next turn, which isn't much!
>Ayotunde_Adeyeri: QT G13 Q.T +45 274
>JD: AADEENT D2 NADA +32 292
#note the AD leave of ENATE scared me, but EET is also pretty weak.

>JD: CEHHNOT K7 H.OCH +36 373
#note didn't know HOOTCH with the T - playing the T gives me an extra shot at the Z.
>Ayotunde_Adeyeri: ENSZ D8 Z.NES +48 430
>JD: EEINOTU H1 I...ET +24 397
#note I'm already dead, Ayo can just block column B if he needs to. essentially this is just a 3 tile fish for INERMOUS!
>Ayotunde_Adeyeri: AJ C3 JA +46 476
>JD: EMNOPUW E11 WOP +28 425
#note right idea leaving an EZINES hook, but the best is PUNT at I11 leaving MEOW!
>Ayotunde_Adeyeri: LOORST M2 TORSO +23 499
#note nice play
