#note Not the best start to the final game. We're both 6-1 with everyone else at least two games back.
>Sam: AFGKNTY J5 FYK.NG +29 29
#note Forgot about FIKY# which sims well too. This got a long hold - it's a noun in TWL ('a bag-shaped fishnet'), but a verb in Collins ('to fidget restlessly'

>Sam: DEEIRVY 8L YE.D +36 279
#note Wow this sims garbagely*. EVERY, which I thought about for a while, is second to REVIED#. I was worried about an X bomb or other high-scoring play.
>Josh_Castellano: AHINPUX 1L .HAP +33 258
#note Cheap setup.
>Sam: ACEIJRV 10A RAJ +30 309
#note RIVA# hoping for REJECT! Didn't consider JA/TAJ/ABA which is nice too. 
>Josh_Castellano: AINOPUX 2N XI +40 298
>Sam: CEEIOSV 3C VOICE. +24 333
#note I wasn't sure of MOZE# which is strong. REVISE simming well too, I considered it. Didn't see UNVOICES. 
>Josh_Castellano: ABENOPU M10 PUBE +22 320
#note Pretty lost here.
>Sam: EEFLNST A10 .EFLET +39 372
#note Changing tacks 
>Josh_Castellano: ALNOOQR 15A .RANQ +15 335
#note Pretty lost here too. I was fishing for UI.
>Sam: DNNOOSU 14K UNSOD +21 393
#note I had a feeling I could try to end the game with this play, risking an outbingo. Playing four tiles is much more accurate, though.

#note If NASPA has a program for euthanizing washed-up players, I think this tournament is a pretty strong case for my nomination.
