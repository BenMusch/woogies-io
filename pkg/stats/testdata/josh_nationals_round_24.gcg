>Josh: AFHILTV 15K .HIFT +45 374
#note I put down 15K (S)HIVA first but picked it up because I was afraid of not drawing enough vowels with FLT to get the bing I need. I didn't even consider Q bombs. RIP. Even 15K (S)HAFT is alright, this is a huge oversight. #strategylarge

#note This went down because I saw I could hit AVERAGE in two spots if I got really lucky.
>Jesse: ADEEEIR L6 DEARIE +17 467
#note a much better play here is RIDE at F4, which still almost always goes out (unless I draw the E, in which case his rack is trash). Also I give him ABBA/ABBE from 8L, which is usually his best play.
