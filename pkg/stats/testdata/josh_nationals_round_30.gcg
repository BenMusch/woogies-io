#note If I win this game by 229, I go to the finals. However, Austin also knows this, so I was just going for a win. A 229 blowout is already extremely unlikely and it becomes basically impossible if your (competent) opponent is attempting to prevent one as opposed to just winning. I'm not sure what would have happened if I had won by 228 and we tied for second.
