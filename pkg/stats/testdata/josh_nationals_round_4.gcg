#note I should have considered letting the play stay on for longer. I was thinking that with the blank, I would very likely bing next turn anyway, and a lost challenge also has a psychological effect. But I didn't consider that if I left it without holding she might hook it later. I dunno.

#note I had her on sticks including the D after this. Since I didn't have a good block I'd thought I set up my S, though maybe I should have just done H1 TONUS. I'm not really sure how big of a mistake this is, I'll just mark it as #strategymedium

#note Not gonna lie, I was a little pissed this went down given her last play.
