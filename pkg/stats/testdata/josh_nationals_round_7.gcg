>Josh: EEELOPW 8G WEEP +18 18
#note 8D PEWEE #knowledgemedium
>Jesse: AHIILRS 9I HI +22 22

>Jesse: AAEILRS K2 AERIALS +74 96
>Josh: AEEGILT F3 EGALITE +71 113
>Jesse: ABMOOSU J2 BOOM +32 128
#note seemed tougher to overlap than BOOM at J3 (because nothing will overlap OE on column L).
>Josh: DLOORTW I3 WO +22 135
#note Most of the equity plays open way too much, I think this is alright.
>Jesse: AEIMRSU E9 MAUSIER +72 200
>Josh: DELLORT D4 TROLLED +76 211
>Jesse: IJOOPTU 15E .OJI +33 233
#note Q strongly prefers UPROOT at this spot instead of ROJI because ROJI leaves a huge scoring spot at 14F, especially if Josh has Z.
>Josh: DDDEIRS 14B DRI.D +29 240
#note Chickened out of 14H DIDDERS. #knowledgelarge
>Jesse: GIOPTTU 10J PIGOUT +30 263
#note Missed opportunity - all 6 Ns are out (!) and so keeping IG with PUTTO has a great chance of turning into a potent -ING leave. PIGOUT also just gives up a lot of free points.
>Josh: DEEGNSY O8 GY.E +24 264
#note 6J Y(A)G #visionlarge
>Jesse: ABNNTVY M9 B.TANY +28 291
#note turning over tiles in hunt of a blank. Q prefers BONNY at M9, which surprises me. I guess BOTANY sets up huge scoring plays at L12. Also 4 Ns unseen so keeping NV has disaster potential.
>Josh: DEFINRS L12 DIF +30 294
#note FIND is the best equity but I need to play 11I DIF to keep the N open except I wasn't 100% on PIPI. #knowledgeSAD
>Jesse: FNRSTUV 11G FRUST +28 319
#note moar turnover
>Josh: AENNRST 6K .NN +3 297
>Jesse: ACCINVV N2 VINCA +30 349
#note ANN suggests that he doesn't have a blank (otherwise he'd try to score more) so I'm lucky he opened a spot where I can flip over even more tiles!
>Josh: ?AENRST 13G REANo..TS +60 357
>Jesse: ?ACEEUV 12A CAVE. +26 375
#note I knew I was safe after CAVES because I found that I have multiple outs no matter what tile I draw, even with the Q X and Z. Q thinks it's my only pre-endgame that wins 8/8! By keeping the U, I have flexibility if I draw the Q, and if he draws it I'll be able to go out first.
>Josh: EKNOQXZ 3E Z.X +27 384
>Jesse: ?AEU C4 AUnE +12 387
